# Overview of Use Cases

## Use Case 1 - Centre for DLT, University of Malta (UM)

Together with the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technology at the University of Malta we develop a centralised application centred around student voting. It demonstrates the integration of WIDE with traditional OAuth services, like Google's Single Sign On service. The target audience for this use-case are students at the University of Malta's Centre for Distributed Ledger Technologies.

### User Stories - University of Malta (UM)

- As a student, I want to be able to securely cast my vote online during university elections, ensuring that my choice is accurately recorded.
- As a student, I want to be able to prove that I am a student at UM without revealing any additional information about my identity.
- As a student, I want to be able to receive attestations regarding my abilities from the lecturers.
- As a student, I want a simple and fast verification process to prove my eligibility for the voting process.
- As a university/faculty administrator, I want a tool to verify students' eligibility for university voting (or other activities that require verification) without compromising their privacy.
- As the University of Malta, I want a reliable and secure platform to issue and manage digital certificates for my students.

## Use Case 2 - CryptoHub Community

For CryptoHub Malta we provide digital authentication facilities to bridge the OAuth to Web3 gap. The target audience for this use-case are professionals and enthusiasts within the space, that range across developers, consultants, and lawyers among others.

- As a member, I want to receive digital proof-of-attendance certificates when I take part in CryptoHub's events and/or take part in educational programs provided by them.

## Use Case 3 - RaidGuild DAO

To highlight the global and online-only adaptability of WIDE, we create an authentication mechanism for a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation. This use-case is intended to demonstrate and explore the applicability of WIDE for a DAO. The target audience for this use-case are DAO users.
