# WIDE Core Library

**WIDE** is short for Web3 Identity for DAOs and Education. The project was incepted in response to the 2023 #OC1 by the NGI TRUSTCHAIN consortium. **WIDE** is being developed and maintained by a consortium led by acurraent UG, coordinated by Joshua Ellul, Director of the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technologies at the University of Malta, and the technical lead Matthew Scerri .

For enabling Web3 identities to be used by DAOs and in education, **WIDE** enables users to export their 

## Executive Summary
## A Decentralised Identity Bridge

## Scope of Work

## Features

## Functionalities

The WIDE digital identity bridge enables users to export identity data from wallets of closed identity networks and use the identity data with their Ethereum-compliant key pairs throughout the full identity lifecycle. All data is protected through client-side encryption and presented to relying parties through reversed Open Identity Connect flows. The WIDE bridge acts as privacy preserving, but server-based remote storage of encrypted claims. When the wallet presents claims, it requests them from the WIDE bridging server. The wallet then acts as a proxy to forward the data to the relying party. The relying party can verify that a dataset with the same hash was indeed uploaded
