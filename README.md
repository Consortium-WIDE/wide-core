# WIDE Core Library

**WIDE** is short for Web3 Identity for DAOs and Education. The project was incepted in response to the 2023 #OC1 by the NGI TRUSTCHAIN consortium. **WIDE** is being developed and maintained by a consortium led by acurraent UG, coordinated by Joshua Ellul, Director of the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technologies at the University of Malta, and the technical lead Matthew Scerri .

For enabling Web3 identities to be used by DAOs and in education, **WIDE** enables users to export their 

## Executive Summary

## A Decentralised Identity Bridge

## Scope of Work

## Definitions

### Digital Identity Bridge

### Verifier

### Relying Party

### Identity Proxy

### WIDE Bridging Server

## Features

1. UI-based data export
2. Privacy-preserving cloud storage
3. Web3-based open authentication
4. Simple data sharing
5. Reliable identity storage
6. Native EVM-support
7. Portable and trustworthy data attestations
8. Simple UI-based identity card management

## Functionalities

The WIDE digital identity bridge enables users to export identity data from wallets of closed identity networks and use the identity data with their Ethereum-compliant key pairs throughout full identity lifecycles. All data is protected through client-side encryption and presented to relying parties through reversed Open Identity Connect flows. In short, WIDE provides exporting, persisting, as well as encryption -, storage -, and presentation capabilities for long-lived any-wise identifiers in storage-scarce Web3 wallets. 

Bridging refers to the privacy preserving, but server-based remote storage of encrypted claims and their presentation over Web2 flows. When the wallet presents claims, it requests them from the WIDE bridging server. The wallet then acts as a proxy to forward the data to the relying party. The relying party can verify that a dataset with the same hash was indeed uploaded. Thus, WIDE reverse implements Web2 to Web3 onboarding solutions in dataflows optimised for verifiers.
